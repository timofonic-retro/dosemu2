>There exist various ways of starting DOSEMU, depending on the environment
and certain command line options. By default, in X, it will start using
a special 'DOS in a Box' which provides a usual PC setup, using a 80x25
text mode. It also supports graphics. The box can be rescaled by dragging
the window borders using the mouse.</P
><P

instance when logging in remotely from a Windows system or at the Linux
console. You can force it using:

<TABLE

><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>      $ dosemu -t</PRE

>

In this mode the display of graphics is impossible, but you can use
full-screen DOS text mode applications. It is advisable to give the
terminal window a size of 80 by 25 characters, or use "stty cols 80 rows 25"
on the Linux console, before starting it because many DOS applications
are confused about other sizes.</P
><P
>You can use the $_internal_char_set option in ~/.dosemurc or dosemu.conf
to change the code page that DOSEMU thinks that DOS is using.</P
><P
>Many terminals do not support various function key combinations. On the
Linux console you can work around that by using the raw keyboard mode
(-k flag, or $_rawkeyboard). <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xterm</B
>'s support many
key combinations. In
other cases you'll have to work around it using the special
<B

>1.1.2. Dumb mode</A
></H4
><P
>For DOS applications that only read from standard input and write to
standard output, without any full-screen usage, you can use dumb
mode. To use this you must invoke DOSEMU like

<TABLE

WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>      $ dosemu -dumb</PRE

this has the advantage that (A) the output of the DOS application stacks
up in your scroll buffer and (B) you can redirect it to a file such as

></H3
><P
>It is possible to use a different DOS than the supplied FreeDOS in
DOSEMU. A straightforward way is to just copy the relevant system
files (io.sys, msdos.sys, etc.) to ~/.dosemu/drive_c, and then the
next time you run dosemu it will automatically use them. You may
need to edit config.sys and autoexec.bat though, if the DOS complains.</P
><P
>Another way is to boot directly from a Linux mounted FAT partition,
with Windows 9x or any DOS installed. You can change the C: drive
to point to that by using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>dosemu -i</B
>.</P
><P
>In that case the DOSEMU support commands are available on drive D: instead
of drive Z:. You might want to use different config.sys and autoexec.bat
files with your DOS. For example, you can try to copy D:\config.emu
and D:\autoemu.bat to C:\, adjust them, and use the $_emusys option
in ~/.dosemurc or dosemu.conf.</P
><P
>Manual adjustment of the C: drive is also possible, by changing the
~/.dosemu/drives/c symbolic link or by specifying it explicitly
using the $_hdimage run-time option.</P

This documentation is derived from a number of smaller documents. This makes it
easier for individuals to maintain the documentation relevant to their area of

documentation on a large project like this quickly becomes too much for one

><P
>Most of DOSEMU configuration is done during runtime and per default it
can use the system wide configuration file dosemu.conf (which is often
situated in /etc or /etc/dosemu) optionally followed by the users
~/.dosemurc and additional configurations statements on the commandline
(-I option). If /etc/dosemu.users exists then dosemu.conf is searched for
in /etc and otherwise in /etc/dosemu (or an alternative sysconfdir
compiletime-setting).</P
><P
>The default dosemu.conf and ~/.dosemurc have all settings commented
out for documentation purposes; the commented out values are the
ones that DOSEMU uses by default. Note that a non-suid type of installation 
does not need the dosemu.users and dosemu.conf files, and the main 
per-user configuration file is $HOME/.dosemurc.
However, for security reasons, a suid-root installation will not
run without dosemu.users, and in that case certain dosemu.conf settings
are ignored by ~/.dosemurc.</P
><P
>In fact dosemu.conf and ~/.dosemurc (which have identical syntax)
are included by the systemwide configuration script global.conf which,
by default, is built into the DOSEMU binary.  As a normal user 
you won't ever think on editing this, only dosemu.conf and your personal 
~/.dosemurc.  The syntax of global.conf is described in detail in 
README-tech.txt, so this is skipped here. However, the option -I string too
uses the same syntax as global.conf, hence, if you are doing some special
stuff (after you got familar with DOSEMU) you may need to have a look there.</P
><P
>The first file expected (and interpreted) before any other configuration
(such as global.conf, dosemu.conf and ~/.dosemurc) is /etc/dosemu.users
or /etc/dosemu/dosemu.users. As mentioned above, this file is entirely
optional for non-suid-root (default) installations.

binary is non-suid-root. If you really trust a user you may additionally give
the keyword `unrestricted', which will allow this user to execute a suid-root
binary even on a private lib directory (though, be aware).</P

>After the file dosemu.users, the file dosemu.conf (via global.conf, which

and only during global.conf parsing the access to all configuration options is
allowed. dosemu.conf normally lives in the same directory as dosemu.users,
for instance /etc/dosemu or /etc (that is, sysconfdir in compiletime-settings).

Your personal ~/.dosemurc is included directly after dosemu.conf,
but has less access rights (in fact the lowest level), all variables you
define within ~/.dosemurc transparently are prefixed with `dosemu_' such
that the normal namespace cannot be polluted (and a hacker cannot overwrite
security relevant enviroment variables). Within global.conf only those
~/.dosemurc created variables, that are needed are taken over and may
overwrite those defined in dosemu.conf.</P
><P
>The dosemu.conf (global.conf) may check for the configuration variables,
that are set in dosemu.users and optionaly include further configuration
files. But once dosemu.conf (global.conf) has finished interpretation,

><P
>A hdimage is
a file containing a virtual image of a DOS-FAT filesystem. Once you have
booted it, you (or autoexec.bat) can use `lredir' to access any directory
in your Linux tree as DOS drive (a -t msdos mounted too).
Look at chapter 5 (Using Lredir) for more details.
If you want to create your own hdimage use "mkfatimage16" (see the manual
page). To make it bootable you can make it, say, drive F:, and use
"SYS F:" at the DOS prompt. 
The DOSEMU-HOWTO explains how to manipulate it using mtools.</P
><P
>You can also specify a Linux directory containing all what you want to have
under your DOS C:. Copy your IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS or equivalent to that
directory (e.g. DOSEMU_LIB_DIR/bootdir), set

and up it goes. Alternatively you can specify
an absolute path such as "/dos" or "/home/username/dosemu/freedos". 
DOSEMU makes a lredir'ed drive out of it and can boot from it. 
You can edit the config.sys and the autoexec.bat within this directory 
before you start dosemu.
Further more, you may have a more sohisticated setup. Given you want to run
the same DOS drive as you normal have when booting into native DOS,
then you just mount you DOS partition under Linux (say to /dos) and
put links to its subdirectories into the boot dir. This way you can decide
which files/directories have to be visible under DOSEMU and which have to be
different. Here a small and not complete example bootdir setup:

><P
>In some rare cases you may have problems accessing Lredir'ed drives
(especially when your DOS application refuses to run on a 'network drive'),
For this to overcome you may need to use so-called `partition access',
use a floppy, or a special-purpose hdimage. The odd
with partition access is, that you <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>never</I
></SPAN
> should have
those partition
mounted in the Linux file system at the same time as you use it in DOSEMU
(which is quite uncomfortable and dangerous on a multitasking OS such as
Linux ). Though DOSEMU checks for mounted partitions, there may be races
that are not caught. In addition, when your DOSEMU crashes, it may leave
some FAT sectors unflushed to the disk, hence destroying the partition.
Anyway, if you think you need it, you must have r/w access to the partition
in /dev, and you have to `assign' real DOS partitions as follows:</P

Note that (other as in native DOS) each piece of mem is separate, hence
DOS perhaps will show other values for 'extended' memory. To use EMS
memory you must load the supplied ems.sys device driver. For XMS memory

fdxms.sys, or fdxxms.sys, or the internal XMS driver via ems.sys.</P

fashion, so if you would like to use an autoexec.bat replacement then

>When running DOSEMU from console (also remote from console) or X you
may need to define a proper keyboard layout. It is possible to let
DOSEMU do this work automatically for you (see <SPAN

>auto</I
></SPAN
> below), however,
this may fail and you'll end up defining it explicitely. This is done either
by choosing one on the internal keytables or by loading an external
keytable from DOSEMU_LIB_DIR/keymap/* (which you may modify according
to your needs). Both sets have identical names (though you may add
any new one to DOSEMU_LIB_DIR/keymap/*):

You define an internal keytable such as

<TABLE

WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>      $_layout = "name"</PRE

where `name' is one of the above. To load a keytable you just prefix
the string with "load" such as

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

to use this feature under X, because by default the keytable is
forced to be neutral (us). Normally you will have the correct settings
of your keyboard given by the X-server.</P
><P
>The most comfortable method, however, is to first let DOSEMU set the
keyboard layout itself. This involves 2 parts and can be done by setting

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>      $_X_keycode = (auto)</PRE

></TR
></TABLE
>

which  checks for existence of the X keyboard extension and if yes,
it sets $_X_keycode to 'on', that means the DOSEMU keytables
are active. The second part (which is independent from $_X_keycode)
can be set by

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>      $_layout = "auto"</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

DOSEMU then queries the keyboard layout from the kernel or X (which
only does work on the console or X, but not in remote text terminals)
and generates a new DOSEMU
keytable out of the kernel information. This currently seems
only to work for latin-1 layouts, the latin-2 type of accents
seem not to exist so far in the kernel (linux/keyboard.h).
The resulting table can be monitor with DOSEMU 'keytable dump'
feature (see README-tech.txt) for details).</P
><P
>When being on console you might wish to use raw keyboard, especially
together with some games, that don't use the BIOS/DOS to get their
keystrokes.

><P
>The builtin ASPI driver (a SCSI interface protocol defined by Adaptec) can be
used to run DOS based SCSI drivers that use this standard (most SCSI devices
ship with such a DOS driver). This enables you to run hardware on Linux, that
normally isn't supported otherwise, such as CD writers, Scanners e.t.c.
The driver was successfully tested with Dat-streamers, EXABYTE tapedrives,
JAZ drives (from iomega) and CD writers. To make it work under DOSEMU
you need

check the devicetype of the SCSI device such as

WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    $_aspi = "sg2:WORM"</PRE

in which case you define /dev/sg2 being a CD writer device. If you omit
the type,

<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE

    $_aspi = "sg2 sg3 sg4"</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE

DOSEMU will refuse any device that is a disk drive (imagine, what would happen
if you try to map a CD writer to the disk which contains a mounted Linux FS?).
If you <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>want</I
></SPAN
> to map a disk drive to DOSEMU's ASPI driver, you need to
tell it explicitely

<TABLE

WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

and as you can see, `Direct-Access' is the devicetype reported by

<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR

><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

which will list all SCSI devices in the order they are assigned to
the /dev/sgX devices (the first being /dev/sg0). You may also use the
DOSEMU supplied tool `scsicheck' (in src/tools/peripher), which helps
a lot to get the configuration right:

<TABLE

all into one), hence you would get problems accessing sg2 and sg4. For this
you may remap a different targetID such as

and all would be fine. From the DOS side the CD-ROM appears as target 5
and the WORM (CD writer) as target 6.
Also from the above scsicheck output, you can see, that you can opt
to use a `host/channel/ID/LUN' construct in place of `sgX' such as

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

></TR
></TABLE
>

which is exactly the same as the above example, exept it will assign
the right device, even if for some reasons you have changed the order
in which sgX device are assigned by the kernel. Those changes happen, if
you turned off power of one device `between' or if you play with dynamic
allocation of scsi devices via the /proc/scsi interface such as

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"

><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"

to add a device. HOWEVER, we <SPAN

><P

> big problem remains: the (hard coded) buffersize for
the sg devices in the Linux kernel (default 32k) may be to small for DOS
applications and, if your distributor yet didn't it, you may need to
recompile your kernel with a bigger buffer. The buffer size is defined
in linux/include/scsi/sg.h and to be on the secure side you may define

<A
HREF="http://www.sat.dundee.ac.uk/~psc/dosemu_time_advanced.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.sat.dundee.ac.uk/~psc/dosemu_time_advanced.html</A

using the $_timemode variable:

<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>      $_timemode = "bios"
      $_timemode = "pit"
      $_timemode = "linux"</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

Most users will only ever have a need for either BIOS or LINUX mode,
and the decision comes down to the two basic characteristics:
<P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>In BIOS mode, the DOSEMU session begins with the current (local)
date &amp; time, and once running it behaves fully like an emulated PC.
You can set the date &amp; time using the normal DOS methods as you would expect.
However, time keeping accuracy in the long term under DOS was never very good,
and under DOSEMU it is typically poorer.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>In LINUX mode, the emulated PC always reports the current host time,
and so you no longer have the option to set the DOS time (the date can be
set, which is odd, as this is kept in DOS and not in the emulator). In
this mode you get the long term accuracy of the host, so if you are
running NTP or similar, you always get accurate time.</P
></LI
></UL
>

The PIT mode is an odd compromise, it provides BIOS-like time
(settable, decoupled from host time), but with slightly higher
accuracy. In summary, if you need accurate time, choose LINUX mode,
otherwise if you need time setting capabilities or close 'real' PC
emulation, choose BIOS mode.</P
><P
>A reasonable question for some applications is
"how do I get accurate UTC time?", of course, the more general question is
about running the emulated DOS session in a different timezone and/or with
differing "daylight saving" options to the host computer.
This is quite simple in fact, just start DOSEMU with the environment
variable TZ set to the required zone, and don't forget to have the
corresponding command in the DOS autoexec.bat file (otherwise
Microsoft products all assume -8 hours PST!). The DOSEMU emulation
of file system access is also based on the local timezone it is running in,
so you will get consistent file time stamps compared to the emulated time.
So in the UTC case, you would start DOSEMU in a shell with TZ=GMT0, and
have a line in autoexec.bat with "set TZ=GMT0" before any of your programs
are run.</P

>Don't set the "s" bit, as DOSEMU can run in
lowfeature mode without the "s" bit set. If you want fullfeatures
for some of your users, it is recommended to use "sudo". Alternatively
you can just use the keyword `nosuidroot' in
/etc/dosemu.users to forbid some (or all) users execution of
a suid root running dosemu (they may use a non-suid root copy of
the binary though).
DOSEMU now drops its root privileges before booting; however
there may still be security problems in the initialization code,
and by making DOSEMU suid-root you can give users direct access to
resources they don't normally have access too, such as selected I/O
ports, hardware IRQs and hardware RAM.
For any direct hardware access you must always use the "-s" switch.</P
><P
>If DOSEMU is invoked via "sudo" then it will automatically switch to
the user who invoked "sudo". An example /etc/sudoers entry is this:
<TABLE

><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    joeuser  hostname=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/dosemu.bin</PRE
></TD

If you use PASSWD instead of NOPASSWD then users need to type their
own passwords when sudo asks for it. The "dosemu" script can be
invoked using the "-s" option to automatically use sudo.</P

CDROM driver aztcd.c by me. With the latter CDROM-drives changing the CD-ROM 
is not recognized correctly by the drive under all circumstances and is 
therefore disabled. So eject.com will not work.
For other CD-ROM drives you may enable this feature by setting the variable
'eject_allowed = 1' in file dosemu/drivers/cdrom.c (you'll find it near the 
top of the file). With the mcd.c and aztcd.c Linux drivers this may cause your

>Some DOS applications want precise mouse control that is only possible

need to grab the mouse by pressing &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Home&gt;.
Similarly, you can grab the keyboard by pressing

&lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Shift&gt;&lt;K&gt; if your
window manager already grabs &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;K&gt;.
After you grab the keyboard
all key combinations (including &lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt; and so on)
are passed to DOSEMU.
In fullscreen mode the mouse and keyboard are both automatically grabbed.</P

the DOSEMU session, which is useful if you want it to sit silently
in the background when it is eating too much CPU time.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;PgDn&gt; or click the close button
of the window to exit DOSEMU.</P

>DOSEMU uses bitmapped internal fonts by default, so it can accurately
simulate a real VGA card text mode. It is also possible to use X fonts.
The advantages of these is that they may be easier on the eyes, and
are faster, in particular if you use DOSEMU remotely. Any native DOS font
setting utilities do not work, however. To set an X font use the
provided xmode.com utility, using

<P
>As the typical graphics mode with 320x200x8 will be used often
with large scalings and modern graphics boards are pretty fast,
Steffen Winterfeldt added something to eat up your CPU time: you can turn on
the bilinear interpolation. It greatly improves the display
quality (but is rather slow as I haven't had time yet to implement
an optimized version - it's plain C for now).
If the bilinear filter is too slow, you might instead try the linear
filter which interpolates only horizontally.</P
>

<P
>Note that (bi)linear filtering is not available on all
VGA/X display combinations. The standard drawing routines
are used instead in such cases.</P
>

<P
>If a VGA mode is not supported on your current X display, the graphics
screen will just remain black. Note that this <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>does not</I
></SPAN
> mean
that DOSEMU has crashed.</P
>

<P
>The only unsupported VBE function is VGA state save/restore. But this
functionality is rarely used and its lack should not cause
too much problems.</P
>

<P
>VBE allows you to use the horizontal and vertical scrolling
function even in text modes. This feature is not implemented.</P
>

<P
>If you think it causes problems, the linear frame buffer (LFB)
can be turned of via dosemu.conf as well as the protected mode
interface. Note, however, that LFB modes are faster than
banked modes, even in DOSEMU.</P
>

<P
>The default VBE mode list defines a lot of medium resolution
modes suitable for games (like Duke3D). You can still
create your own modes via dosemu.conf. Note that you
cannot define the same mode twice; the second (and all
subsequent) definitions will be ignored.</P
>

<P
>Modes that are defined but cannot be supported due
to lack of video memory or because they cannot be
displayed on your X display, are marked as unsupported
in the VBE mode list (but are still in it).</P
>

<P
>The current interface between VGAEmu and X will try to update
all invalid video pages at a time. This may, particularly
in hi-res VBE/SVGA modes, considerably disturb DOSEMU's signal
handling. That cannot be helped for the moment, but will
be addressed soon (by running an extra update thread).</P
>

<P
>If you really think that this is the cause of your problem, you might
try to play with veut.max_max_len in env/video/render.c.
This variable limits the amount of video memory that is updated
during one timer interrupt. This way you can dramatically
reduce the load of screen updates, but at the same rate reduce your
display quality.</P
>

<P
>Gamma correction works in both 4 and 8 bit modes. It must be specified
as a float value, e.g. $_X_gamma=(1.0). Higher values
give brighter graphics, lower make them darker. Reasonable
values are within a range of 0.5 ... 2.0.</P
>

<P
>You can specify the video memory size that the VGA emulator
should use in dosemu.conf. The value will be rounded up
to the nearest 256 kbyte boundary. You should stick to typical
values like 1024, 2048 or 4096 as not to confuse DOS applications.
Note that whatever value you give, 4 bit modes are only
supported up to a size of 800x600.</P
>

<P
>You can influence the initial size of the graphics window in various
ways. Normally it will have the same size (in pixel) as the VGA graphics
mode, except for mode 0x13 (320x200, 256 colors), which will be scaled by
the value of <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>mode13fact</I
></SPAN
> (defaults to 2).
Alternatively, you can directly specify a window size in dosemu.conf via
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>$_X_winsize</I
></SPAN
>. You can still resize the window later.</P
>

<P
>The config option <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>$_X_fixed_aspect</I
></SPAN
> allows you to fix the aspect ratio
of the graphics window while resizing it. Alternatively, <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>$_X_aspect_43</I
></SPAN
>
ties the aspect ratio to a value of 4:3. The idea behind this is that, whatever
the actual resolution of a graphics mode is in DOS, it is displayed on
a 4:3 monitor. This way you won't run into problems with modes such
as 640x200 (or even 320x200) which would look somewhat distorted otherwise.</P
>

<P
>For planar modes (for instance, most 16 colour modes, but also certain
256-colour modes: mode-X), vgaemu has to
switch to partial cpu emulation. This can be slow, but expect it to
improve over time.</P

>By the time of writing this, DOSEMU does not have support
for Windows ring-0 device drivers (.vxd, .386). Fortunately, most of
Windows 3.1 drivers are ring-3 ones (.drv), so you can easily
install the Sound Blaster drivers, for instance. This is not the
case with Windows 3.11. Its network drivers are ring-0 ones, so
the native Winsock does not work. In order to get networking
operational, you need to get the Trumpet Winsock package. Refer

DOSEMU... But for those who need it, here are some basic hints.
The DOS shell is supported by DOSEMU only if Windows is running in
Standard mode. The Enhanced mode DOS shell is currently unsupported.
Note however, that unlike in a real DOS environment, under DOSEMU
the DOS shell of the Windows in Standard mode allows you to run
protected mode applications (in the real DOS environment only the DOS shell
of the Enhanced mode allows this).</P

>Under X, or in terminal mode, you don't need to do anything, unless you want

On the console, in text mode, without root, the GPM library can be used,
and no extra setup is necessary.
Otherwise, especially with console graphics (sudo/suid/root, the -s switch,
and $_graphics=(1)), it takes just a tad bit more work:</P

<TABLE

This sets you up to use the gpm mouse repeater if you don't
use the repeater, you need to set $_mouse and $_mouse_dev to
different values.

The GPM repeater might be configured to use a different protocol
than the default.  If you are having problems, check the 'repeat_type' setting
in your gpm.conf.  These are the mappings from the GPM repeat_type to the
DOSEMU $_mouse for common settings:

></H3
><P
>In X there are 2 ways applications can get into trouble.</P
><P
>The most common way is if they don't trust the mouse driver
to keep track of where the mouse is on the screen, and insist
on doing it themselves. win31 &#38; geoworks are too applications
in this category.  They read mouse movement from the mouse
driver in turns of mickeys i.e. they read the raw movement data.</P
><P
>To support this mouse driver then tracks where you were and where you
move to, in terms of x,y screen coordinates.   Then works the standard
formulas backwards that calculate screen coordinates from mickeys to
generate mickeys from screen coordinates.  And it feeds these mickeys
to the application.  As long as the application and dosemu agree on
the same formulas for converting mickeys to screen coordinates all is
good.</P
><P
>The only real problem with this is sometimes X mouse and the
application mouse get out of sync.  Especially if you take your
mouse cursor out of the dosemu window, and bring it back in again.</P
><P
>To compensate for getting out of sync what we do is whenever we
reenter the Xdos window is send a massive stream of mickeys heading
for the upper left corner of the screen.  This should be enough to
kick us any an good mouse drivers screen limits.  Then once we know
where we are we simulate movement for 0,0.  </P
><P
>In practice this isn't quite perfect but it does work reasonably well.</P
><P
>The tricky part then is to get the application and dosemu to agree on
the algorithm.  The algorithm we aim at is one mickey one pixel.
Dosemu does this by default under X but you can force it with.

in the '[windows]' section of win.ini</P
><P
>The fool proof solution is to take total control of the mouse in X.
This is controlled by the $_X_mgrab_key in /etc/dosemu.conf
$_X_mgrab_key contains an X keysym of a key that when pressed
with both Ctrl &#38; Alt held down will turn on the mouse grab, which
restricts the X mouse to the dosemu window, and gives dosemu complete
control over it.  Ctrl-Alt-$_X_mgrab_key will then release the
mouse grab returning things to normal.</P
><P
>I like: $_X_mgrab_key="Scroll_Lock"  (Ctrl-Alt-Scroll_Lock)
but $_X_mgrab_key="a" is a good conservative choice. (Ctrl-Alt-A)
You can use xev to see what keysyms a key generates.</P
><P
>Currently the way the X mouse code and the mouse grab are
structured the internal mouse driver cannot display the mouse
when the mouse grab is active.  In particular without the grab
active to display the mouse cursor we just let X draw the mouse for
us, (as normal).  When the mouse grab is active we restrict the mouse
to our current window, and continually reset it to the center of the
current screeen (allowing us to get relative amounts of movement).
A side effect of this is that the the position of the X cursor and the
dos cursor _not_ the same.  So we need a different strategy to display
the dos cursor.</P
><P
>The other way an application can get into trouble in X, and also
on the console for that matter is if it is partially broken.  In
particular the mouse driver is allowed to return coordinates that
have little to no connection with the actual screen resolution.  So an
application mouse ask the mouse driver it's maximums and then scale
the coordinates it gets into screen positions.  The broken
applications don't ask what the maximum &#38; minimum resolutions are
and just assume that they know what is going on.</P
><P
>To keep this problem from being too severe in mouse.c we have
attempted to match the default resolutions used by other mouse
drivers.  However since this is up to the choice of an individual
mouse driver there is doubtless code out there developed with
different resolutions in mind.</P
><P
>If you get stuck with such a broken application we have developed a
work around, that is partially effective.  The idea being that if the
application draws it's own mouse pointer it really doesn't matter
where the dos mouse driver thinks the mouse is things should work.
So with emumouse it is possible to set a minimum resolution to return
to an application.  By setting this minimum resolution to as big or
bigger than the application expect to see it should work.  The side
effect of setting a minimum resolution bigger than the application
expects to see in X is that there will be some edges to the of
the screen where the application draws the cursor at the edge of the
window, and yet you need to continue scrolling a ways before the cursor
comes out there.  In general this will affect the right and bottom
edges of the screen.</P
><P
>To read the current minimum use:

If you application doesn't draw it's own mouse cursor a skew of this
kind can be nasty.  And there is no real good fix.  You can set the
mininum down as well as up and so it may be possible to match what
the app expects as an internal resolution.  However there is only
so much we can do to get a borken application to run and that 
appears to be the limit.</P

The '...' will be 'typed in' by DOSEMU exactly as if you had them

    \Pn;   Set the virtual typematic rate, thats the speed for
           autotyping in. It is given in unix timer ticks to wait
           between two strokes. A value of 7 for example leads to
           a rate of 100/7=14 cps.
    
    \pn;   Before typing the next stroke wait n unix ticks.
           This is useful, when the DOS-application flushes the
           keyboard buffer on startup. Your strokes would be discarded,
           if you don't wait.

>14.1. Direct NIC access</A
></H3
><P
>The easiest (and not recommended) way to set up the networking
in DOSEMU is to use the direct NIC access. It means that DOSEMU
will exclusively use one of your network interfaces, say eth1.
No other processes will be able to use that interface. If they
try to, the data exchange will became unreliable. So you have
to make sure that this network interface is not used by anything
including the kernel itself, before starting DOSEMU.
The settings for this method are as follows:
<TABLE

BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    $_pktdriver = (on)
    $_ethdev = "eth1"
    $_vnet = "eth"</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Note that this method requires root privileges.</P
><P
>As you can see, this simple method has many shortcomings. If
you don't have the network card dedicated specially for dosemu,
consider using more advanced method called "Virtual Networking".</P

>Virtual networking is a mechanism that allows to overcome all the
limitations of the direct NIC access method, but it requires more
work to set up everything properly.
A special virtual network devices can be created using TUN/TAP interface.
This will enable multiple dosemu sessions and the linux kernel to be on
a separate virtual network. Each dosemu will have its own network device
and ethernet address.</P
><P
>First make sure that your Linux kernel comes with support for TUN/TAP;
for details check Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt
in the Linux kernel source. The user who runs DOSEMU should have 
read/write access to /dev/net/tun. Then either:

given above, 192.168.74.2-192.168.74.254 would be good. 
Your network should now be up and running and you can, for example,
use a DOS SSH client to ssh to your own machine, but it will
be down as soon as you exit DOSEMU.</P

>Obtain tunctl from the user mode linux project. Then set up a persistent
TAP device using tunctl (use the -u owner option if you do that as root).
Configure the network using ifconfig as above, but now before starting
DOSEMU. Now start DOSEMU as often as you like and you can use the network
in the same way as you did above.</P
><P
>Note, however, that multiple DOSEMU sessions that run at the same time
need to use multiple tapxx devices. $_netdev can be changed without
editing dosemu.conf/~./dosemurc (if you leave it commented out there)
by using [x]dosemu -I "netdev tap1".</P
></LI
></OL
></P
><P
>With the above you did set up a purely virtual internal network between
the DOSEMU and the real Linux box. This is why in the
above example 192.168.74.1 should *not* be a real IP address of the
Linux box, and the 192.168.74 network should not exist as a real
network. To enable DOS programs to talk to the outside world you have
to set up Ethernet bridging or IP routing.</P
><DIV
CLASS="SECT3"
><HR><H4
CLASS="SECT3"

NAME="AEN924"
>14.2.1. Bridging</A
></H4
><P
>Bridging, using brctl (look for the bridge-utils package if you don't
have it), is somewhat easier to accomplish than the IP routing. 
You set up a bridge, for example named "br0" and connect eth0 and
tap0 to it. Suppose the Linux box has IP 192.168.1.10 on eth0, where
192.168.1.x can be a real LAN, and the uid of the user who is
going to use DOSEMU is 500, then you can do (as root):
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    brctl addbr br0
    ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 promisc up
    brctl addif br0 eth0
    ifconfig br0 192.168.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
    tunctl -u 500
    ifconfig tap0 0.0.0.0 promisc up
    brctl addif br0 tap0</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Now the DOSEMU's IP can be set to (for example) 192.168.1.11.
It will appear in the same network your linux machine is.</P

><DIV
CLASS="SECT3"
><HR><H4
CLASS="SECT3"
><A
NAME="AEN928"
>14.2.2. IP Routing</A
></H4
><P
>If you like to use IP routing, note that unlike with bridging,
each DOSEMU box will reside in a separate IP subnet, which consists
only of 2 nodes: DOSEMU itself and the corresponding TAP device on
Linux side.
You have to choose an IP address for that subnet. If your LAN has the
address 192.168.1.0 and the netmask is 255.255.255.0, the dosemu subnet can
have the address 192.168.74.0 and tap0 can have the address 192.168.74.1:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    ifconfig tap0 192.168.74.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 up</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Choose a valid IP address from that subnet for DOSEMU box. It can be
192.168.74.2. Configure your DOS client to use that IP. Configure your
DOS client to use a gateway, which is the TAP device with IP 192.168.74.1.
Then you have to add the proper entry to the routing table on your Linux
box:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    route add -net 192.168.74.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev tap0</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
The resulting entry in the routing table will look like this:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    Destination   Gateway  Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
    192.168.74.0  *        255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 tap0</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>

Then, unless the Linux box on which DOSEMU is running is a default
gateway for the rest of you LAN, you will have to also add an entry
to the routing table on each node of your LAN:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    route add -net 192.168.74.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.10</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
(192.168.1.10 is the IP of the box DOSEMU is running on).
Also you have to check whether IP forwarding is enabled, and if not -
enable it:
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    echo 1 &#62; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
Now DOSEMU will be able to access any node of your LAN and vice versa.</P
><P
>Yet one more thing have to be done if you want dosemu to be able to
access Internet. Unlike in your LAN, you are not supposed to change
the routing tables on an every Internet host, so how to make them
to direct the IP packets back to dosemu's virtual network? To
accomplish this, you only have to enable the IP Masquerading on
the network interface that looks into Internet. If your machine
serves as a gateway in a LAN, then the masquerading is most likely
already enabled, and no further work is required. Otherwise you
must add the following into your iptables configuration file
(assuming the eth0 interface serves the Internet connection):
<TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>    *nat
    -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
    COMMIT</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
After restarting iptables, you'll find your dosemu session
being able to access Internet. For more info about the IP Masquerading
have a look into IP-Masquerade-HOWTO.</P

>14.3. VDE networking backend</A
></H3
><P
>If you just need to have a working internet access from within your
DOSEMU environment, then you might want to consider using VDE networking.
slirpvde is a user mode networking utility providing a NAT-like
service, DHCP server, as well as a virtualized network in the 10.0.2.0/24
range, with a default gateway and a DNS server.
Note that dosemu uses VDE backend as a fallback when other methods are
unavailable. It also tries to start all the vde utilities, so no
configuration efforts are usually needed.</P
