><P
>The Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) can be programmed to produce
interrupts with frequencies up to almost 2MHz. Linux sets this to
only 100Hz (2.6 kernels can set it to 1KHz) and doesn't allow the
software to change that. This limits the minimal interval between subsequent
SIGALRM notifications for software that uses the setitimer(2) syscall.
To emulate the PIT frequencies that are higher than the frequency Linux
sets the PIT to, dosemu uses "interrupt bursts": on every SIGALRM
reception dosemu triggers the timer interrupt as many times as necessary
to compensate the gap since the previous SIGALRM reception. This allows
to keep a precise timing but causes problems for some programs. When
the timer interrupt handler is invoked more than once without letting
the main thread to execute, some programs can lock up. The game "Cosmo" is
one of those.</P
><P
>Another problem is that due to the aforementioned low timer frequency
dosemu is not able to properly emulate the timings for different
emulated hardware. That also causes problems for some programs.
Scream Tracker 3, for example, can lock up at startup because the
interrupt from an emulated SB card can be triggered earlier than it
should be in a real system.</P

>" A procedure may use the POPF instruction to change the setting of the IF
 flag only if the CPL is less than or equal to the current IOPL. An attempt
 by a less privileged procedure to change the IF flag does not result in
 an exception; the IF flag simply remains unchanged. "</P
><P
>The fact that the exception is not being generated, prevents dosemu from
catching and properly simulating the POPF instruction executed in protected
mode. That, in particular, means that the following code, executed in
protected mode (not in v86 mode) under dosemu, will end up with interrupts
disabled (IF cleared):</P

[ the interrupts are still disabled here ]</P
><P
>This bug can only affect DPMI programs, as using DPMI is the only way
to execute protected mode code under dosemu.
Known programs that are affected are the games from ID software, namely
Doom2 and Duke Nukem 3D, but only when configured with sound.
An optional work-around was added to dosemu, which just re-enables the
interrupts if they were disabled for too long in protected mode.
Additionally the address of the instruction that disabled the interrupts,
is added to a black-list and this instruction is ignored for subsequent
passes so that it can't disable the interrupts any more.
This is potentially unsafe, but if the timeout is long enough, no harm
was observed so far.
The timeout is configured via the $_cli_timeout option, which is measured
in a 10ms timer ticks. Setting that option to 0 disables the workaround
completely, making Doom2 unplayable with sound enabled.</P

chapter "Specification Clarifications"
section 4: "Use Of ESP In 16-Bit Code With 32-Bit Interrupt Handlers",
which reads as follows:</P
><P
>"ISSUE: When a 32-bit IRET is used to return to another privilege level,
and the old level uses a 4G stack (D/B bit in the segment register = 1),
while the new level uses a 64k stack (D/B bit = 0), then only the 
lower word of ESP is updated. The upper word remains unchanged. This is 
fine for pure 16-bit code, as well as pure 32-bit code. However, when
 32-bit interrupt handlers are present, 16-bit code should avoid any
dependence on the upper word of ESP. No changes are necessary in existing
16-bit code, since the only way to access ESP in USE16 segments is 
through the 32-bit address size prefix."</P
><P
>The corruption happens when the Linux kernel returns control to the dosemu
process, while a 32-bit DPMI client that uses a 16-bit data segment for
the stack is active. This is not the usual case, but unfortunately some
32-bit DPMI clients are actually using a 16-bit segment for the stack,
and even the dos4gw extender behaves that way sometimes.</P

>Syndicate Wars (when used with dos4gw 0.8)</P

>Open Cubic Player</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>These programs are crashing shortly after startup, but this problem
is difficult to detect reliably, so there may be many more programs
that experience a random crashes due to this CPU bug.</P
><P
>The reliable work-around was developed and added into linux-2.6.12
for 32-bit systems, and into linux-3.16 for 64-bit systems.</P
