 *  pic.c is a fairly complete emulation of both 8259 Priority Interrupt
 *  Controllers.  It also includes provision for 16 lower level interrupts.
 *  This implementation supports the following i/o commands:
 *
 * VERB
 *      ICW1    bits 0 and 1     number of ICWs to expect
 *      ICW2    bits 3 - 7       base address of IRQs
 *      ICW3    no bits          accepted but ignored
 *      ICW4    no bits          accepted but ignored
 *
 *      OCW1    all bits         sets interrupt mask
 *      OCW2    bits 7,5-0       EOI commands only
 *      OCW3    bits 0,1,5,6     select read register,
 *                               select special mask mode
 *
 *     Reads of both pic ports are supported completely.
 * /VERB
 *
 *  An important concept to understand in pic is the interrupt level.
 *  This is a value which represents the priority of the current interrupt.
 *  It is used to identify interrupts, and IRQs can be mapped to these
 *  levels(see pic.h~). The currently active interrupt level is maintained
 *  in pic_ilevel, which is globally available,   A pic_ilevel of 32 means
 *  no interrupts are active; 0, the highest priority, represents the NMI.
 *  IRQs 0 through 15 are mapped, in priority order, to values of 1-15
 *  (there is no IRQ2 in an AT). Values of 16 - 31 represent additional
 *  interrupt levels available for internal dosemu usage.
 *
 *     More detail is available in the file README.pic
 *
 *  Debug information:
 *
 *  A debug flag of +r or 1r will generate debug messages concerning
 *  reads and writes to pic ports.  Many of these messages are not yet
 *  implemented.  A debug flag of 2r will generate messages concerning
 *  activation, nesting, and completion of interrupts.  A flag of -r
 *  or 0r will turn off debugging messages.  Flags may be combined:
 *  to get both 1r and 2r, use a value of 3r.

 *
 * You have run into an old problem, which was created through attempts
 * (not by me) to speed up pic by creating holes in its re-entrancy protection.
 * As I released pic, it was quite safe on this score, however, that made
 * dosemu unpleasantly slow.  For everyone's edification, here's the problem:
 *
 * As dos is designed, it is sometimes necessary to presume that an interrupt
 * (most often the timer, but sometimes the keyboard or even a serial port)
 * could not possibly re-trigger before a certain amount of time has elapsed.
 * Sloppy dos programmers have also often made this assumption even when it was
 * not necessary.
 *
 * Dosemu breaks this assumption, because dos doesn't always have the entire
 * machine, and interrupts can "pile-up" while other processes are running.
 * As far as pic (hardware or emulated) is concerned, an interrupt ends
 * when the interrupt acknowledge is sent to pic.  However, to avoid
 * re-entrancy, pic.c points the iret to a HLT, which is trapped, and used to
 * allow re-triggerring of an interrupt.  This works, and would completely
 * eliminate the above problem, but there's more to the story.
 *
 * Since some programs put great piles of code inside an interrupt ("I've ACK'd
 * the interrupt, what's the hurry on the IRET?"), this kind of hold-off slows
 * dosemu down.  A few (2 or 3) people have modified pic since I released it
 * to create holes in the hold-off mechanism, citing the need for more speed.
 * They were certainly right that speed was needed, but I could never get them
 * to understand the problem they were creating.  These changes are what's
 * creating the re-entrancy, I believe.
 *
 * To make matters worse, dos uses IRETs for software interrupts, even inside
 * hardware interrupt routines.  So the only reliable way to catch the IRET of
 * a hardware interrupt is to point it to a HLT by modifying the stack.  Please
 * don't question this, I've many hours of debugging time that demonstrated
 * this quite thoroughly.
 *
 * BUT...task-switching environments (MS-Win) use hardware interrupts (mostly
 * timer and keyboard, but sometimes serial, too) to switch tasks. When a new
 * task is created, there is no address pointing to a HLT on the (new) stack,
 * so the end of the interrupt code will never be sensed, and the re-trigger
 * protection will lock up dosemu.  So it is necessary to detect this event,
 * and decide that the interrupt has terminated, or we'll never let the timer
 * (or keyboard, etc. as the case may be) interrupt re-trigger.  So, in a way,
 * we MUST create some kind of hole in the hold-off process.
 *
 * The entire pic debate is one of finding the right kind of hole to make, and
 * the trade-off is robustness vs. speed. Since the task switch problem only
 * occurs on the initial invocation of a dos task (when a new stack is built),
 * I elected to use a conservative hole, to maintain robustness.  Others have
 * since modified pic.c to gain speed, often without adequate testing of
 * robustness.
 *
 * There's lots of re-entrancy protection in pic, but it has largely been
 * defeated by speed-up efforts.  Perhaps the best fix is to re-visit those
 * speed-up efforts, and see if a better solution can't be found.
 *
 * My next thing to try was to put back the correct pic_icount stuff and see if
 * I can't set up separate HLTs for each IRQ, automatically releasing any
 * pending (pic_pirr) interrupts when their HLT is encountered.  The pic_icount
 * and related stuf may still be needed for stack switches.  This may be
 * enough to gain the full speed-up without creating significant holes.
 *
 * The other thing I want to do is some timer changes to better guarantee
 * interrupts get activated in their proper order.  This is a bit messy, and
 * I've got the code somewhere. It involves threading the timer queue.  Some of
 * it may already be done, but I think not.
